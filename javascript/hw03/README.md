# JavaScript Homeworks from Class 3
## Section - Loops, Arrays & Objects

### 1. Even/Odd Counter
Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even")

### 2. Top Choice
Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever). For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."

Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is. [The method slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) might be helpful here.

### 3. The Reading List
Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

* Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
* Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
* Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
