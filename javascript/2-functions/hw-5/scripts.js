// Your JS code is here
// Create a function called mixUp. It should take in two strings, and return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. For example:
function mixUp (string1, string2) {
    var str =  string1 + " " + string2
    console.log (str)
        
  }
  
  mixUp ('house', 'country')
  mixUp ('morning', 'school')
