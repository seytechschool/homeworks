// Your JS code is here
// Let's turn one of the "Intro To Programming" Exercises into a function.

//     Write a function named tellFortune that:
//         takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
//         outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
//     Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

function tellfortune(num_of_ch,partner_name,geo_loc,job){
  console.log('you will be a(n) ',job,' in ',geo_loc,', and married to ',partner_name,' with ',num_of_ch,' kid(s)')

}
