# JavaScript Homeworks from Class 1

## Section - Intro to Programming

### Challenge Question: Using Math functions

JavaScript has a built-in tool that can generate a random number between 0 and 1. This tool is called a **_method_**. We'll talk about methods more later in the class. For now, know if you type `Math.random()`, you'll get a random number between 0 and 1.

Using this tool, update your fahrenheit to celsius tempature conversion program to do the following:

- Instead of inputing a value for the Fahrenheit tempature, use Math.random() to generate a random tempature between 0 and 100
- Have to program output: "It is NN°F today. That's NN°C."
